## STARK Verifier 

# Instructions

Build the standalone executable `cargo build` and verify the serialized proof: `./path/to/verifier`

# Generating proofs

Use the python Mimc STARK implementation (modified) to generate serialized stark proofs:  https://github.com/jwasinger/research/tree/serialize/mimc_stark (outputs a binary file called `proof`)
